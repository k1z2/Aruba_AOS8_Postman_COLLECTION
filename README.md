some notes:

1.You need to change the password for the login request.

2.you need to change all the IP addresses in the url.

3. you need to import the environment file before you run the requests.

4.it is generated by a standalone controller, for mm/md architect, you may need to change the config_path in the url.

5.the import part is in the login request, you may see "pm.environment.set('SESSION',Â pm.cookies.get('JSESSIONID'))", basically it is used to get the sessionID, then pass it to environment parameter.
