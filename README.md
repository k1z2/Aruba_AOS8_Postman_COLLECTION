some notes:
1.You need to replace the password for the login request.
2.you need to replace all the IP addresses in the url.
3. you need to import the environment file attached as well.
4.it is generated by a standalone controller. For mm/md architect, you may need to change the config_path in the url.
the import part is in the login request, you may see "pm.environment.set('SESSION',Â pm.cookies.get('JSESSIONID'))", basically it is used to get the sessionID, then pass it to environment parameter.
